# Feature-Selection-Method-of-Morris

**Hypotheses:**

The parameter with the high impact value has the most importance (matters
the most).

**Treatments:**

Morris's method applies to three simulation model parameters (productivity_growth, interest_rate, employment_rate_initial). A function
`goodness_euclidian` is defined to determine the goodness. The impact of different parameters is calculated by using the goodness values.

Please take a look at the pdf `Feature_Selection_Method_of_Morris` for more information.
